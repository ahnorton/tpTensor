The style file needs to be be moved into the StyleSheets directory,

> mv TeXitStyle.nb ~/.Mathematica/SystemFiles/FrontEnd/StyleSheets/TeXitStyle.nb

NB. To use the TeXit package it is essential that your notebook stylesheet be TeXitStyle.
After moving the stylesheet to its correct location the TeXitStyle should be a menu item:

   Format -> Stylesheet -> TeXitStyle

(Mathematica may need to be restarted before this item appears on the menu.)
