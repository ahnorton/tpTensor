% This file is where you define the TeX commands to be used in this paper (e.g., using \newcommand). 
% If deleted, this file will be re-created when TeXit next looks for it. Any edits you make will be
% retained across sessions.
%
% If the Mathematica variable $MyTeXCommands is a valid filename, then that file will be input here:

%  Variable $MyTeXCommands has not been assigned.

% Typical usage would be to assign $MyTeXCommands in your init.m file. But only do that if you don't
% want to bother with editing the copy of this file for each new paper. Otherwise you might as well 
% input it from here.
%
% Files of commands that you regularly use can be input here:
% \input file_name1.tex
% \input file_name2.tex

% Define any other TeX commands for this paper here:
% \newcommand{\MP}{{Mathisson--Papapetrou}}
