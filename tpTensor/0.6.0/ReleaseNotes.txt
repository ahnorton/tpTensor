Release notes for tpTensor-0.5

     Release date: 2 Dec 2015, at  
     
           The Eighth Australasian Conference on General Relativity and Gravitation (ACGRG8)
           2-4 December 2015, Monash University
           http://www.asgrg.org/acgrg8/

     The slides that I used in my talk at ACGRG8 can be found in ./Documentation     

     tpTensor-0.5  is the first *beta* release of tpTensor. 
     This is beta-software and I'd appreciate bug reports / feedback / first impressions.
     
     Many of the higher-level functions for doing differential geometry and general relativity
     are NOT YET INCLUDED by default, because I have not yet decided on final syntax, definition,
     and/or implementation. Pre-release versions of some of these functions can be found within the
     source notebook tpTensor-0.5.nb, but have not been saved (by initialization cell) into the
     package file tpTensor-0.5.m.

     The higher-level differential geometry functions will be included in the first non-beta
     release (to be called tpTensor-1.0), due sometime (early?) 2016. 

     To see what tpTensor can do in its current beta 0.5 release state, see the notebook,

                      ./Examples/dipole_electon_model.nb.

       (This notebook calculates the electromagnetic radiation reaction force on a charged
       dipole particle in flat spacetime. It shows that the equations of motion are governed
       by (the Minkowski version of) the Dixon–Souriau (DS) eqns, corrected by terms for the
       radiation reaction force and torque. The DS eqns generalise the Mathisson–Papapetrou
       equations for a spinning point-like mass to include electromagnetic interactions.
       For a magnetic dipole, the spin supplementary condition (SSC) naturally arises as the
       Frenkel--Pirani (FP) condition.)

     If you look inside tpTensor-0.5.nb you will find that it is a mess. That is because I have
     not yet deleted old code not being used, notes to self, etc. Apologies, but I ran out of
     time to do so before the release date, being that of my talk at ACGRG8.
